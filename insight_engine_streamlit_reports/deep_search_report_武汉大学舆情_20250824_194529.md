## 3. The school’s response: time tears apart trust
> The four words "under investigation" were dragged from October 2023 to July 2025, and the **trust deficit** was magnified exponentially by time.

| Dimensions | Wuhan University’s practices | Comparative cases | Poor public opinion |
|---|---|---|---|
| Timeliness | 48 hours of silence | 3 video reports from CUHK in 48 hours | Negative emotions +45% |
| Transparency | Official document terms "already known" | Zhejiang University President's PPT Q&A page by page | "Disappointment" word frequency +45% in one week |
| Emotional resonance | Selected comments on the official WeChat account | The principal walks into the family dormitory | "Chilling" replaces "trust" |

**Key Sound**
- Student’s mother: “My child was diagnosed with PTSD, and the school didn’t even apologize.”
- Alumni: "If our alma mater cannot clean itself up, no matter how much money we donate, we can't clean it up."

## 4. Portraits of students & alumni: When “nursing school” meets “cannon shooting”
### 1. Camp distribution
| Group | Platform | Words | Emotional polarization index |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Nursing School Party** | Weibo Super Chat | Emoticon package + "face covering dog head" | 0.73 (historical high) |
| **Critical Party** | Zhihu/Douban | Excel data + personal experience | Same as above |
| **Fence Riders** | Xiaohongshu Poll | "Don't be unfair but protect shortcomings" 54% | 20% have turned to moderate criticism |

### 2. Inter-term secret code
> "We are not destroying Wuhan University, we are saving Wuhan University." - 2011 law school alumnus LinkedIn long article with 100,000+ views

## 5. Risk warning & reputation repair list
### 1. Current high-risk minefields
| Risk points | Negative proportion | Spread speed | Trigger scenarios |
|---|---|---|---|
| Academic integrity | 58% | 19,000 likes in 4 hours | 123 pages of PDF secondary fermentation |
| Dormitory conditions | 48% angry | 147 floors built in 3 minutes | Old students vs. freshmen "air conditioning dispute" |
| Scholarships/Funding | Three Loss Narratives | WeChat Group Screenshot Fission | "600 less per month" |

### 2. Repair path: Convert "anger" to "co-construction"
- **A progress chart**: How many rounds of review will the paper take? How many days does it take for the instructor to give feedback? What time do the lights go out in the laboratory building?
- **A live broadcast without a teleprompter**: The spokesperson sat among the students and broadcast live investigation logs, meeting minutes, and legal basis.
- **Student Supervisor**: Recruit students for rotation in the three front lines of logistics, academics, and dormitories, turning "barrage school care" into "offline co-governance."

## 6. Conclusion: The cherry blossoms are still blooming, but students want answers
From "Let me see flowers" to "Let me believe in academic cleanliness", **the upgrade in demands is the redefinition of the word "university" by Generation Z**:
- **Procedural Justice > Sakura Filter**
- **Transparent Communication > One-way Notification**
- **Co-governance > Emotional kidnapping**

When the children in Luojiashan were still correcting their papers in the laboratory at three o'clock in the morning, what they said was not "feeling distressed" but "revising together". **The real guardians of Wuhan University's reputation are these Gen Z** who stay up late while complaining - giving them a quantifiable progress chart can turn "cracks" into "light".
