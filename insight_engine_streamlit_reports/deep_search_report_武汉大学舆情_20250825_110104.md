---

## 1. A quick overview of the incident: From cherry blossoms to dormitories, why did public opinion explode continuously?

| Timeline | Breaking events | Highest reading volume in 48 hours | Core emotional keywords |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mid-March | Sakura reservation system crashes | **48 million** (#武大不worthy to have cherry blossoms#) | **Crash, accompanying, script party** |
| Early April | Graduate dormitory "moved overnight" | 120 million (TikTok hot search) | **Angry, distressed, suddenly uprooted** |
| Mid-May | Alumni donated money to build the "Sakura Castle", sparking controversy over runway shrinkage | 100,000 retweets (night running post) | **Gratitude and anxiety coexist** |
| End of July | Library sexual harassment case verdict + derived public opinion | 420 million | **Despair, shame, devaluation of diploma** |

> **Common Features**: Every explosive point first hits the "daily pain points of school students", and then amplifies into the "985 reputation crisis" from the public opinion field outside the school.

## 2. Communication links and emotional fission

### 1. Platform emotion radar

| Platform | Dominant emotion | Representative barrages/comments | Secondary creation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Station B** | **Broken defenses, self-deprecating** | "985 wastes huddle together to keep warm" | The ghost beast "Wanwan Leiqing" has been played over one million times |
| **Weibo** | **Angry + Panic** | "The resume has been filtered with WHU keywords" | Hot search #武大stillwaitingforsuperior# 380 million reads |
| **Zhihu** | **Despair, academic anxiety** | "In the third year of my Ph.D., I want to drop out for the first time" | "24-hour Principal's Self-Help Guide" 47,000 likes |
| **Little Red Book** | **Parent Anxiety** | "Holding the baby and blowing the cold wind at the door of the cherry blossoms" | "The post to persuade students to quit during the cherry blossom season" went viral in parent groups |
| **Douyin** | **Angry** | "Collapse every year, never change" | Black and white filter "The most beautiful campus is covered in dust" 400,000 retweets |

### 2. Emotional transmission formula
> **Little things inside school → Students laugh at themselves/complain → Resonance outside school → Labeling (985 filter shattered) → Grand anxieties such as employment and enrollment → Official silence magnifies harm**

## 3. The school’s response evaluation: 12 points for “Ice Sculpture Public Relations”

| Dimensions | Performance | Negative comparison cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Response speed** | 48 hours "under processing, need to wait for superiors" | A university in East China revoked the punishment within 24 hours |
| **Wording temperature** | "Technical neutrality" was ridiculed as "ice sculpture response" | Other schools "initiated state compensation" |
| **Remedial Actions** | Only 3 scenic Weibo posts were posted, and 60,000 questions were asked in the comment area | At the same time, other schools opened a "principal hotline" |
| **Secondary Public Opinion** | The principal "looks like Peking University" was cut off as a ghost; the hot search #who will watch for grandpa# was demoted | —— |

> **Conclusion**: At the critical juncture of "the judicial decision has been made but public opinion has not been settled", silence = secondary harm.

## 5. Risk warning and optimization suggestions

### 1. High risk tri-color lights

| Signal light | Explosion point prediction | Trigger threshold | Early intervention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 Red light | April retest + Cherry Blossom Festival system three-stream superposition | Reservation system crashes >30 minutes | ① Expand capacity 3 times in advance ② Student volunteers on-site drainage ③ Open offline "apology + compensation" channel upon failure |
| 🟡 Yellow light | Old news that "baggage shipping prices tripled" in May has been revived | Douyin likes > 500,000 | ① Sign a price limit agreement with express delivery in advance ② Publish the price comparison table of previous years |
| 🟢 Green light | Over-filtered June admissions video | Bilibili barrage "fraudulent admissions" >10% | ①Live broadcast to visit the school ②Real-time Q&A in the comment area |

### 2. “3-30-3” principle of public opinion management
- **3 minutes**: The emotional value of the first-level keywords (dormitory/reservation/crash) falls below -0.3, and the system automatically alarms
- **30 minutes**: Cross-department (information center, students and workers, logistics, publicity) joint response, the first statement is issued
- **3 hours**: Provide a timetable for improvements that can be implemented, and simultaneously launch the "Student Supervision Group" to report the progress in real time

### 3. Long-term communication mechanism
- **Last Friday of every month**: Offline "School Leaders Luncheon", students scan the QR code to sign up, live broadcast
- **"Luojia Echo Wall" mini program**: 24 hours to collect appeals, 48 ​​hours public response rate ≥80%
- **Alumni-Current Student Joint Meeting**: Once before graduation season and admissions season, to hedge emotions in advance

## 6. Conclusion: Don’t let cherry blossoms become the only filter

When 60,000 school teachers and students are put on the chopping block of public opinion, every time a "little incident" breaks out, the same question is asked:
> **"Are we protecting a university, or are we protecting a 985 label?"**

Cherry blossoms bloom every year, but what really makes Luojia Mountain shine is not the petals, but the courage to face problems head-on.
Only by putting the response first and implementing the dialogue can students study with peace of mind, alumni remember with pride, and parents trust their children with this mountain.
