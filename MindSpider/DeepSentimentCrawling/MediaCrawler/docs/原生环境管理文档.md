## Use python native venv to manage dependencies (not recommended)

## Create and activate python virtual environment
> If you are crawling Douyin and Zhihu, you need to install the nodejs environment in advance. The version is greater than or equal to: `16` <br>
> Added [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage project dependencies, using uv to replace python version management and pip for dependency installation, which is more convenient and faster
   ```shell   
# Enter the project root directory
   cd MediaCrawler
   
#Create virtual environment
# My python version is: 3.9.6. The library in requirements.txt is based on this version. If it is other python versions, the library in requirements.txt may not be compatible. Please solve it yourself.
   python -m venv venv
   
# macos & linux activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate

# windows activate virtual environment
   venv\Scripts\activate

   ```

## Install dependent libraries

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## View configuration file

## Install playwright browser driver (optional)

   ```shell
   playwright install
   ```

## Run the crawler program

   ```shell
### By default, the comment crawling mode is not enabled for the project. If you need to comment, please modify the ENABLE_GET_COMMENTS variable in config/base_config.py
### For some other support items, you can also view the functions in config/base_config.py, which are written with Chinese comments.
   
# Read keywords from the configuration file to search for related posts and crawl post information and comments
   python main.py --platform xhs --lt qrcode --type search
   
# Read the specified post ID list from the configuration file to obtain the information and comment information of the specified post.
   python main.py --platform xhs --lt qrcode --type detail
  
# Open the corresponding APP and scan the QR code to log in
     
# For other platform crawler usage examples, execute the following command to view
   python main.py --help
