# Instructions on logging in with mobile phone number + verification code
> The configuration process is quite complicated and this method is not recommended.

When simulating a human to initiate a mobile phone number login request in the browser, use SMS forwarding software to send the verification code to the crawler side for backfilling to complete automatic login.

Preparation:

- 1 Android machine (I have not studied IOS, but it is theoretically possible to monitor text messages)
- Install SMS forwarding software [reference warehouse](https://github.com/pppscn/SmsForwarder)
- Configure WEBHOOK-related information in the forwarding software, which is mainly divided into message templates (please check recv_sms_notification.py in this project) and an API address that can push SMS notifications.
- The push API address generally needs to be bound to a domain name (of course it can also be the IP address of the intranet). I use the intranet penetration method, and there will be a free domain name bound to the intranet web
server, intranet penetration tool [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/)
- Install redis and set a password [redis installation](https://www.cnblogs.com/hunanzp/p/12304622.html)
- Execute `python recv_sms_notification.py` and wait for the SMS forwarder to send HTTP notification
- Execute the crawler program to log in with mobile phone number `python main.py --platform xhs --lt phone`

Remark:

- Will text message forwarding software monitor the content of other text messages on my phone? (Theoretically it shouldn’t be, because [SMS Forwarding Warehouse](https://github.com/pppscn/SmsForwarder)
There are quite a lot of stars)
