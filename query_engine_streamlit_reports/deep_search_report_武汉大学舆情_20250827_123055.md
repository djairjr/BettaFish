## 5. In-depth analysis of public opinion response mechanism and governance issues

### 5.1 Issues with the public opinion management mechanism of Wuhan University

**Systematic defect analysis**:
According to the professional analysis of Dundun Public Opinion Course Studio, Wuhan University has three core problems in handling public opinion:

1. **Misunderstanding the purpose of public opinion handling**
- The school rushed to deal with one party before the incident was fully investigated.
- The handling of public opinion is simply understood as "calming the storm" rather than ascertaining the truth.

2. **There is a huge difference in the degree of attention inside and outside the school**
- Internal emphasis fails to translate into externally perceived actions
- There is a disconnect between internal communication in the administrative system and external information disclosure

3. **Serious public opinion handling "panic"**
- It has a top school of journalism and communication but in actual combat "has no power to fight back"
- Reflects the serious phenomenon of "disconnection between learning and application" in the academic community

### 5.2 Loopholes in the academic governance system

**Quality control system failure**:
- The basic errors in Yang Jingyuan’s thesis passed the supervisor’s review, double-blind review and defense committee review
- No obvious problems were found in the entire postgraduate training quality monitoring process
- Reflects systemic loopholes in the academic quality assurance system

**System implementation lags**:
- According to Wuhan University's "Academic Misconduct Handling Rules", there should be clear time requirements
- However, as of July 30, 2025, the school has not issued a formal investigation statement.
- No action was taken against graduated Yang Jingyuan on the grounds that her "student status was automatically terminated"

### 5.3 Comparative analysis of coping strategies

**Horizontal comparative study**:
Judging from three public opinion incidents in colleges and universities compared with Zhiwei data:

1. "Wuhan University's Kimono Cherry Blossom Viewing" Conflict Incident" influence index 65.4
- The public relations strategy is relatively successful: timely response and clear rule basis
- Support for the school’s decision soared from 26% to 48%

2. The impact of the incident "A teacher at North China Electric Power University was exposed for sexual harassment" was 52.7
- The response is not timely and the processing process is not transparent

3. "Hunan University's investigation of academic misconduct" is the least popular
- Quick response, open procedures

## Comprehensive fact analysis

Colleges and universities need to establish a more scientific and complete public opinion monitoring and response mechanism, and shift from passive response to active prevention.
