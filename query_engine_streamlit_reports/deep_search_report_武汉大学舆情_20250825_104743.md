# Wuhan University Public Opinion Analysis Report

## Overview and definition of public opinion at Wuhan University

Public opinion of Wuhan University refers to the sum of public opinions, emotions and attitudes surrounding Wuhan University and related events in the context of higher education and society. The scope of public opinion monitoring covers many aspects such as academic activities, campus management, teacher and student behavior, and social services. Common types include positive hot spots (such as academic achievements, students' good deeds), negative events (such as management disputes, security incidents), and periodic events (such as admissions, graduation season). In the field of higher education, public opinion management is crucial, because positive public opinion can enhance the school's reputation and social influence, while negative public opinion may impact student values ​​​​and the school's image, and even trigger a public relations crisis. Effective public opinion monitoring requires the help of professional systems (such as Lexi and Yifang Software). These systems provide professional Internet public opinion monitoring services to the government and education departments, including public opinion analysis, early warning and guidance, to achieve real-time collection and rapid discovery of public opinions across the entire network. For example, the Yifang software public opinion monitoring system platform provides opportunities for public opinion monitoring through big data technology, supporting public opinion monitoring, network-wide public opinion analysis and early warning work; Lexi public opinion monitoring emphasizes the comprehensiveness of information and directional search capabilities, jointly supporting the early warning mechanism and response strategies in public opinion management in universities to maintain the stability and development of the school. In addition, public opinion monitoring technology can also assist teaching modeling analysis and improve brand marketing capabilities, reflecting its multi-dimensional application value in the field of education. Technology application cases include AI-driven agents that can better leverage the value of data by calling APIs and data training, as well as research on key technologies such as adaptive noise cancellation. These innovations further enhance the accuracy and practicality of public opinion monitoring.

## Analysis of recent public opinion incidents at Wuhan University

The recent public opinion incidents at Wuhan University have mainly focused on the two core issues of Yang Jingyuan’s academic misconduct incident and the false accusation case in the library. In July 2025, after Yang Jingyuan, a master's degree graduate of Wuhan University, lost the lawsuit for long-term false accusations of sexual harassment against a junior student named Xiao, her master's degree thesis "Economic Analysis of the Impact of Fertility Behavior on Domestic Violence in China and India" was exposed for serious academic fraud, including the fictitious "Divorce Law" that did not exist ", falsification of data sources (falsifying 36.1% of the data published by the WHO into 28.3%), errors in historical common sense (such as miswriting 1949 as 1049), and systematic academic misconduct such as logical errors, preset conclusions, massive plagiarism, and variable manipulation. This incident not only exposed Yang Jingyuan’s personal lack of academic integrity, but also revealed systemic loopholes in Wuhan University’s graduate training, thesis review mechanism, and academic ethics construction. The public reacted strongly, questioning the mentor's guidance responsibility and the failure of the defense committee's review. They also criticized the school's slow response after the incident was exposed. It was not until August 1 that the central media paid attention and announced the formation of a special work team to conduct a comprehensive investigation and review. In addition, the incident was intertwined with the false accusation case in the library: Xiao received a demerit due to being falsely accused and lost his qualifications for graduate school and law examinations. His family suffered long-term trauma due to Internet violence (his grandfather passed away due to being stimulated and became a vegetative state). However, Yang Jingyuan was granted graduate school qualifications and admitted to Hong Kong Baptist University (later confirmed to be a research assistant instead of a doctoral student). She even publicly showed off her achievements after losing the case, triggering widespread doubts about the procedural justice and ethical review mechanisms of universities. Although Hong Kong Baptist University issued an ethics verification letter on July 31 and initiated an independent review process, the news of "revocation of admission qualifications" circulated on August 6 was confirmed to be a rumor. The school only stated that it would be handled according to disciplinary procedures without announcing a specific decision. This handling method is in sharp contrast with the public's expectation of "zero tolerance" for academic misconduct. The incident has caused serious damage to the reputation and credibility of Wuhan University, and has become a typical case for reflection on the academic integrity and institutional supervision of higher education in China. It is worth noting that during the investigation, Yang Jingyuan tried to defend herself by uploading thesis revision documents through Baidu Netdisk. However, according to China's academic management regulations, archived dissertations are not allowed to be revised in principle. This behavior further raised public doubts about the execution of academic norms. At present, the school remains silent on the dispute over the revision of the paper. The final results of Wuhan University and Hong Kong Baptist University are still pending, and the public continues to pay attention to the progress of the incident.

## Public opinion response strategies and measures

Wuhan University has demonstrated multi-level response strategies in public opinion management, but crisis events in recent years have exposed challenges in its mechanism. Take the false accusation case in the library in 2023 as an example. In the early days, the school quickly punished students based on unilateral accusations and tried to calm public opinion through the "handle first for respect" approach. However, after the court's decision was reversed, it triggered a more serious public backlash, highlighting the problems of insufficient investigation, delayed response, and eagerness for accountability in crisis management. In terms of official response, Principal Zhang Pingwen's remarks about "waiting for arrangements from superiors" reflected the slow internal decision-making, which resulted in "paying great attention" only at the internal level, creating a huge gap in public perception and damaging trust; the school did not provide specific investigation basis during the incident, and the information window period was too long, exacerbating the impression of concealment. The school issued a notice through the Ministry of Security to clarify rumors (such as the motor vehicle stop incident in 2025), and took legal actions such as reporting the case, which reflects the strategy of combining communication and action. However, the problem of disconnection between learning and application (such as relying on backward means such as ‘persuading deletion on the ground’ and the lack of a dynamic public opinion monitoring mechanism) shows that practical capabilities need to be strengthened to avoid the disconnect between theoretical knowledge and actual handling. Insufficient research and judgment on public opinion led to the failure to predict the reversal of the wind direction, and the response was mechanical and passive, and the window for restoring trust was missed. In addition, the incident also revealed the school’s inadequate response to social public opinion phenomena such as ‘extreme feminism’ and the need for a deeper understanding of the background of public opinion. In general, Wuhan University needs to optimize response speed, ensure the fairness of investigations, establish a transparent communication mechanism (such as timely release of 'one-on-one' verification responses and remedial measures), and mitigate negative public opinion through a dynamic tracking and early warning system to repair reputation and improve public opinion management effectiveness.

## The impact of public opinion on the reputation of Wuhan University

Wuhan University has faced many public opinion incidents in recent years, which have had a significant impact on the school's reputation, enrollment, academic cooperation and social image. According to Zhiwei data analysis, the influence index of Wuhan University's "Kimono Cherry Blossom Viewing" conflict in 2021 reached 65.4, which is 10.8% higher than the average of similar events, attracting widespread public attention. In the early days of the incident, there was a relatively high proportion of negative views, questioning the school's insularity and the violent behavior of security guards. However, through a timely public relations response, Wuhan University issued a situation statement emphasizing that tourists did not make reservations and were verbally provocative. The trend of public opinion reversed, and the proportion of people supporting the school's decision rose from 26% to 48%. This reflects the effectiveness of positive responses in public opinion management and helps maintain social image.

However, other incidents such as the campus traffic conflict in 2025, and some self-media spread false information such as "children of faculty and staff are arrogant and do not stop students" have led to negative discussions. Netizens have questioned the privileges of campus management, such as the details of punitive measures to cancel vehicle access authorization for three months and the campus driving permissions of off-campus personnel. Although the school quickly clarified that the driver involved was the child of a retired employee outside the school and had no privileges, and reported the case to the police to deal with the rumors, the incident still exposed the potential harm of rumors to reputation. In addition, academic-related controversies, such as Xiao’s disciplinary action and Yang’s paper investigation, spread through the media and social platforms, affecting trust in academic cooperation.

In terms of enrollment, Wuhan University's total enrollment has increased in 2024, enrolling 7,215 students nationwide, and the number of majors enrolled in the strong foundation plan has increased from 8 to 9, showing the school's efforts in expanding enrollment. However, principal Zhang Pingwen’s inappropriate remarks in the promotional video have aroused doubts on the Internet, and we need to be alert to the potential negative impact on enrollment. It is worth noting that the gender pattern of higher education in the country has changed significantly. In 2023, women will account for 52.22% of undergraduate students, and girls will account for 63% of enrollments. However, women in top universities such as the C9 Alliance only account for 37.7%. As a comprehensive university, Wuhan University needs to pay attention to the impact of professional gender differentiation (for example, the male-to-female ratio in the School of Computer Science is 4.88:1, and the female school in the School of Journalism and Communication exceeds 80%) on enrollment diversity and social image.

Generally speaking, public opinion incidents may bring short-term fluctuations to enrollment and cooperation, but Wuhan University's response strategies - such as rapid response and transparent communication - mitigate the negative impact to a certain extent, highlighting the need for universities to strengthen public opinion monitoring and public relations wisdom to protect their reputation. Comments from Xinhua News Agency and other media pointed out that public opinion should avoid being "superior but not realistic", emphasizing that universities need to improve their administrative sensitivity to prevent incompetent handling of incidents from further damaging their image.

## Future public opinion trends and suggestions

The public opinion challenges that Wuhan University may face in the future are mainly focused on insufficient transparency, low communication efficiency and lack of prevention mechanisms. Based on the search results, Wuhan University’s library incident exposed problems of delayed response and long information window period, leading to a loss of public trust. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the public opinion monitoring and early warning system, use artificial intelligence technology (such as BERT model, sentiment analysis) to track online public opinion dynamics in real time, and improve research and judgment capabilities. It is recommended to establish a rapid response mechanism to ensure that the investigation process is open and transparent and avoid vague strategies; to optimize the internal communication process to reduce delays caused by layer-by-layer reporting; and to introduce blockchain technology or deep learning models (such as CNN) to strengthen campus public opinion analysis and achieve multi-dimensional event processing. In addition, public opinion cases should be reviewed regularly, crisis public relations plans should be improved, and public concerns should be responded to through professional and good-faith communication to repair reputational damage. Combining cutting-edge technology trends, Wuhan University can learn from the innovative applications of big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence in smart city management to promote the upgrade of public opinion management methods and models, such as using artificial intelligence and blockchain to improve supply chain resilience and collaborative benefits, and strengthen business efficiency improvements after 2024. By integrating next-generation information technologies such as 5G and semiconductors, we will accelerate the construction of intelligent public opinion warning and response systems, improve transparency and communication efficiency, and prevent potential crises. It is worth noting that in the 2024 Financial Technology Innovation Competition, the Wuhan University team demonstrated the application potential of blockchain and artificial intelligence, such as the "Blockchain Wars Supply Chain Melting Carbon to Generate Gold" project, which provides a technical reference for public opinion management and can explore the use of blockchain for data transparent storage and AI-driven sentiment analysis to enhance the real-time and credibility of public opinion response. At the same time, attention should be paid to AI ethics and governance frameworks, such as avoiding algorithm bias and privacy risks, ensuring that technology applications comply with international standards, and improving the sustainability and inclusiveness of overall public opinion management.

## in conclusion

Based on the above analysis, Wuhan University’s public opinion management faces significant challenges, especially in terms of academic integrity, transparency and response mechanisms. Recent incidents such as Yang Jingyuan’s academic misconduct and the false accusation case in the library have exposed systemic loopholes and impacted the school’s reputation. In the future, Wuhan University needs to strengthen technology applications (such as AI and blockchain), optimize communication strategies, and establish preventive mechanisms to improve its ability to respond to public opinion and maintain long-term reputation and development.
