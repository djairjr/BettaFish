# Overview of public opinion of Wuhan University: Public scrutiny under the aura of a prestigious school

As a prestigious top university in China, Wuhan University has long carried high social expectations, and its every move has been under close public scrutiny. This "aura of a famous school" makes it easy to fall into the whirlpool of public opinion due to controversial events while enjoying a high reputation. In recent years, Wuhan University's public opinion has shown a complex situation in which positive reputation and negative controversy coexist. In addition to positive publicity such as scientific research results, its official publicity methods and crisis management capabilities have also been repeatedly tested. Especially in the era of social media, the speed and breadth of information dissemination have been unprecedentedly amplified, allowing local incidents to quickly ferment into national public issues.

Take the high-profile "library incident" in 2023 as an example. The storm began when a female student filmed and accused a male student of the same school of "masturbating" in the library and "sexually harassing" her. The incident quickly exploded on the Internet. Under the initial pressure of public opinion, the school gave the boy a demerit for "indecent behavior." However, with the court's subsequent first-instance judgment on July 25 rejecting all of the woman's claims and finding that "it cannot be concluded that the boy Xiao Moumou committed sexual harassment against a specific target," the nature of the incident reversed, and the focus of public opinion shifted from "sexual harassment" to a discussion of "false accusations" and crisis management in universities. After the verdict, Wuhan University remained silent for nearly a month, even attracting attention and criticism from official media such as Xinhua News Agency. It was not until August 1, under tremendous pressure from public opinion, that the school issued a notice stating that it had set up a special work team to conduct a comprehensive investigation and review. Throughout the incident, the school was widely criticized by public opinion for its slow response and lack of responsibility, which caused serious damage to the school's reputation. In addition, an article from Wuhan University titled "Gamer Teenagers' Counterattack Issued Top Issues, Wuhan's Li Zhan Won the Lei Jun Award!" "The official tweet has also caused widespread controversy due to its promotional methods. These cases profoundly reflect that in the current media environment, a single negative event or improper publicity may have an impact on the brand image and social trust of a century-old university, highlighting the severe challenges faced by top universities in responding to public opinion crises.

## Analysis of recent hot public opinion events

In recent years, a series of public opinion incidents have triggered extensive social discussions, involving many fields such as business operations, digital space governance, and educational ethics. By combing and analyzing these specific cases, we can deeply explore their causes, development context and public reactions. In terms of business operations and consumer rights, incidents such as Pinduoduo’s “One-Knife” campaign raised suspicions of fraud due to opaque rules, well-known restaurant chain stores were exposed to selling expired food, and incidents such as “67.96 liters of oil were added to a 50-liter fuel tank”, all of which touched the vital interests of consumers and the bottom line of business integrity, quickly igniting public anger and discussions on market supervision. At the level of digital space governance, from the massive public outcry caused by a certain social software software being suspected of leaking user privacy, to the judicial trial for manipulating "cyber trolls" to spread false information, these incidents reflect the public's strong concern for the protection of personal information and the urgent need for the purification of the online environment. In addition, events in the fields of education and social ethics have also attracted much attention. For example, Wuhan University’s annual “Sakura Festival” is a periodic hot spot of public opinion. In order to cope with the influx of tourists, the school has implemented an online reservation system since 2016 to limit the flow of people. However, this has not quelled the controversy, but has repeatedly triggered new public opinion disturbances. Relevant conflict incidents occurred frequently, such as tourists arguing with security guards because they did not make an appointment, and even physical conflicts caused by being refused admission to the school due to their attire (such as a suspected kimono). These incidents quickly evolved into a public opinion war with the participation of all people after being spread on the Internet, stimulating intense discussions on whether universities should have "walls" and how to balance campus management and public openness. In addition to the controversies caused by this kind of campus management, the academic turmoil of specific scholars and controversial incidents involving students' personal behavior are also particularly prominent, such as the "cat abuse" incidents that have occurred in many places. Such incidents often spark public opinion when videos or pictures of abuse are circulated online, and their brutal content quickly arouses strong public indignation and condemnation. The focus of public opinion not only focused on criticism of the abuser's personal morals and mental state, but also escalated to a review of the school's handling of the abuse, with calls for expulsion from school rising. At the same time, the recurrence of such incidents has continued to trigger in-depth discussions on strengthening animal protection legislation and establishing a more complete social life education system, profoundly testing the ethical responsibilities and crisis management capabilities of educational institutions. What these incidents have in common is that they often stem from challenges to rules, fairness, and ethical bottom lines, and through the amplification effect of social media, they quickly ferment into public discussions of national concern.

## The formation and dissemination of positive public opinion images

The positive public opinion image of Wuhan University is the result of multi-dimensional and in-depth construction. Among them, the label of "The Most Beautiful University" is undoubtedly the most communicable cultural symbol. This reputation stems from its unique campus environment - backed by Luojia Mountain, surrounded by the East Lake, the palace-style buildings are simple and elegant, combining Chinese and Western styles, especially the cherry blossoms in full bloom in spring, which have become a cultural event attracting national attention. At the communication level, Wuhan University is good at using online new media platforms to carry out "micro-publicity", approaching and attracting young people through vivid new media discourse and integrated media forms, and subtly ingraining the image of "the most beautiful university" in the hearts of the public. For this reason, it has been repeatedly commended in the construction of network culture.

However, its reputation's "stabilizing" role comes more from its deep hard power. First of all, in terms of historical heritage, Wuhan University can be traced back to 1893. As a national "985 Project", "211 Project" and one of the first batch of "Double First-Class" key construction universities, its historical status and academic inheritance itself are a guarantee of credibility. Secondly, in terms of scientific research strength, Wuhan University, as a top comprehensive university with a wide range of disciplines, has made repeated breakthroughs in scientific research and innovation in recent years, demonstrating its strong academic reputation and innovation capabilities. Furthermore, in terms of talent training, Wuhan University took the lead in implementing the "Three Innovations" education with "creation, innovation, and entrepreneurship" as the core, and established experimental areas such as "Hongyi Academy" to cultivate top innovative talents with an international perspective. Finally, the social impact of outstanding alumni is a powerful testament to and living advertisement for their reputation. From business leaders such as Xiaomi founder Lei Jun and Taikang Insurance Group founder Chen Dongsheng, to academic leaders such as Nobel Prize winner Yang Zhenning, to cultural celebrities such as scholar Yi Zhongtian, these outstanding alumni from all walks of life have continuously contributed to the reputation of their alma mater with their outstanding achievements. These factors jointly consolidate its positive and positive public image, allowing it to maintain strong stability and reputation in the field of public opinion.

## Negative public opinion and the challenge of crisis management

Wuhan University has faced multiple public opinion challenges in recent years. The key factors are not only limited to improper handling of emergencies, but also involve inappropriate words and deeds of individual teachers and students, academic integrity issues, and the construction of teacher ethics and ethics. Take the "Wuhan University Library Incident" that has attracted widespread attention as an example. This incident exposed the dual dilemma of handling internal conflicts on campus and responding to external public opinion. The incident originated from a female student who posted an article on the Internet, accusing another male student of sexually harassing her by "rubbing her lower body through his pants" in the library. She also attached a video and a handwritten apology letter from the boy. The accusation quickly spread through the Internet and eventually evolved into a typical campus public opinion crisis. In handling this crisis, Wuhan University's response strategy faced severe challenges and exposed many shortcomings.

The school's response was ineffective, mainly reflected in its slow and passive response. It failed to take the lead in handling the incident in the face of turbulent public opinion. Instead, it was led by public opinion, resulting in a passive situation of "double helix disorder". More importantly, the handling process was accused of deviating from the rule of law: disciplinary decisions were made against the male student in question without sufficient factual investigation. However, in the subsequent judicial proceedings, the court held that the existing evidence could not determine that the boy's behavior constituted sexual harassment against a specific target, and that his behavior had a "high possibility of scratching an itch", so it rejected all the girls' claims. After the court's ruling, the school failed to correct its mistakes in time. Instead, under the pressure of public opinion, it announced the establishment of a special work class on August 1, 2025, to conduct a comprehensive investigation and review of issues such as boys' disciplinary actions and girls' dissertations. This response method violates the basic principles of "fact investigation first" and "procedural justice". Some cadres habitually delay "waiting for superior arrangements" and have been criticized by the outside world as "passing the blame upwards", which has seriously damaged the credibility of the school.

In addition to the "library incident", the school also faces other crises caused by issues of teacher ethics and academic integrity. For example, Yang Moumou, a researcher at the school's animal experiment center, was recently reported to have verbally harassed a female student. After the school investigation verified that his behavior seriously violated teachers' professional ethics, he was fired. In addition, an associate professor at the China Institute of Boundary and Ocean Research was also reported in real name for allegedly plagiarizing a student paper, triggering discussions about academic misconduct, and the school said it had intervened in the investigation. These successive incidents together highlight the common shortcomings of universities in crisis management.

Effective crisis management should be based on "prevention in advance," including establishing a cross-departmental professional crisis management team, formulating detailed response plans, and using modern information technology to establish a normalized public opinion monitoring system. When dealing with emergencies, we must adhere to the bottom line of the rule of law and ensure the legality of decision-making and the fairness of procedures, so as to fundamentally reduce the impact of the crisis and maintain the reputation and stability of the school.

## Summary and Outlook: Public Opinion Ecology and Reputation Management in Colleges and Universities

The public opinion incidents at Wuhan University in recent years, from the initial hasty handling under the pressure of public opinion, to the reversal and review of subsequent incidents, the complexity and multifaceted nature of the handling process make it a typical microcosm of observing the challenges of Chinese higher education in the new media era. This case highlights the tendency of universities to fall into passivity or even "disorder" in the face of turbulent public opinion. Its representative significance is far-reaching. In the self-media environment represented by Weibo, WeChat, etc., the reputation of universities is a valuable intangible asset, and its management and maintenance are crucial.

Looking to the future, in order to cope with the instantaneous and widespread communication characteristics of new media, Wuhan University and other universities must shift from passive response to active management and establish a more forward-looking and flexible reputation management and public opinion response mechanism. Specifically, we should start from the following aspects:
1. **Establish a normalized and scientific public opinion monitoring system**: A cross-departmental public opinion response team composed of school management, professional teachers, student representatives, etc. should be established, and a modern public opinion monitoring platform should be used to monitor social media, news websites and other channels around the clock to provide data support for decision-making.
2. **Establish a rapid and authoritative crisis response mechanism**: When facing online public opinion about emergencies, universities must release authoritative information through official channels as soon as possible, respond to public concerns in a timely manner, and announce the truth of the incident and the progress of handling it. Speaking proactively and quickly is the key to controlling public opinion and preventing rumors from spreading.
3. **Construct a response principle with the rule of law as the core**: Colleges and universities should not become "yes men in the field of public opinion", but should be the guardians of the spirit of the rule of law. When handling controversial events, we must adhere to the core principles of "fact investigation precedes administrative decisions, procedural justice is more important than result efficiency, and individual rights are more important than the pressure of public opinion" to ensure the fairness and legitimacy of decision-making and avoid being swayed by irrational public opinion.
4. **Construct a proactive and diverse brand narrative matrix**: University reputation management should not stop at crisis response, but also focus on daily brand image building. The awareness of "the whole school is one game" should be strengthened, the resources of various departments should be integrated, and a collaborative and efficient new media communication matrix should be formed. Through live video, short videos, graphics and other diversified forms, we proactively showcase the school’s faculty, teaching facilities, campus culture and brand activities. By telling warm brand stories, we establish a deep emotional connection with the public and build a solid “reservoir” for the school’s reputation.
5. **Strengthen two-way interaction and transparent communication**: Establish a long-term communication mechanism and use new media’s real-time feedback functions such as commenting and sharing to obtain opinions and market needs from all parties in a timely manner. Through transparent and sincere communication, we can not only strengthen interaction and understanding with students, media and the public in daily management, but also more effectively consolidate the school's credibility and good reputation when a crisis occurs.
