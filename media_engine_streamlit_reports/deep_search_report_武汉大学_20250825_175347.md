It is a comprehensive national key university directly under the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. As a key university under the national "985 Project" and "211 Project", Wuhan University is also one of the first batch of "Double First-Class" universities, reflecting its outstanding status and important influence in China's higher education system. The school has a long history of running schools, which can be traced back to the Ziqiang School founded by Zhang Zhidong, the governor of Huguang in the late Qing Dynasty in 1893. After inheritance and evolution, it was named National Wuhan University in 1928. It is one of the first national comprehensive universities in modern China. In 2000, Wuhan University merged with Wuhan University of Hydraulic and Electric Power, Wuhan University of Surveying and Mapping Technology, and Hubei Medical University to form a new Wuhan University. The disciplinary advantages were further integrated and the comprehensive strength was significantly enhanced. The school has strong academic strength. In the fourth round of subject evaluation by the Ministry of Education, its four subjects, namely Marxist Theory, Geophysics, Surveying and Mapping Science and Technology, and Library, Information and Archives Management, received top A+ grades. The total number of A-category subjects reached 19, ranking among the top universities in the country. Globally, its remote sensing technology discipline ranks first in the world, and water resources engineering, library and information science and other disciplines are also among the world's leaders. With its outstanding achievements in discipline construction, a total of 11 disciplines of the school have been selected into the national “Double First-Class” construction list. The campus is surrounded by mountains and rivers, surrounded by Luojia Mountain and East Lake. The natural scenery and cultural landscape complement each other and is known as one of the most beautiful university campuses in China.

## Campus environment and humanistic heritage

Wuhan University is known as "the most beautiful university in China". Its unique campus scenery comes from the perfect blend of natural landscape and humanistic architecture. The campus is located on the bank of the Yangtze River and the East Lake, with Luojia Mountain as the screen and the East Lake water as the mirror. Its early campus planning is a masterpiece and model of modern university campus construction in China. It pioneered the implementation of functional zoning and cleverly used traditional Chinese gardening techniques such as contrasting scenery and borrowing scenery. It followed the mountain's situation and organically integrated the buildings into nature, creating an overall environment with beautiful lakes, mountains and beautiful scenery. The Cherry Blossom Avenue in spring is the most famous landscape of Wuhan University. When the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, the shadows of the flowers are intertwined with the sound of reading in the morning. "History and youth are written on one page here."

The landmark building complex of the campus was built in the 1930s. It is the only university building complex in modern China that was completely planned and built in a short period of time. The solemn archway at the school entrance is engraved with "National Wuhan University" on the front and "Liberal Arts, Science, Engineering, Agriculture and Medicine" on the back, demonstrating its grand academic vision as a comprehensive university. The design concepts of these buildings are based on "inherent Chinese forms" and achieve the perfect fusion of Chinese and Western styles. Its appearance shows Chinese classical features such as cornices and brackets, and glazed tile roofs. The overall layout follows the traditional principles of "axial symmetry, master-slave order"; the interior uses advanced Western construction technologies and structures such as reinforced concrete at the time, and incorporates Western classical elements such as Romanesque and Byzantine styles. Climbing up the stairs along Cherry Blossom Avenue is the architectural complex represented by Laozhaishe. It is built on the mountain and looks like the Potala Palace. It is majestic. The old library, located on the top of the Lion Mountain, as the highest point and spiritual symbol of the campus, makes people admire it with its majestic octagonal eaves. In addition, the "Eighteen Luojia Mountain" villas were built to attract top famous teachers, Hongru, which testifies to the school's respect for talents.

It is this harmonious unity of landscape and architecture, nature and humanity that has given birth to the unique humanistic spirit of Wuhan University. The solemn and profound historical buildings have accumulated the century-old spirit since the "Self-Strengthening School" in 1893, while the beautiful natural scenery gives the campus a free and open aura, thus forming Wuhan University's unique "Luojia culture" and campus spirit.
